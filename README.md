What is Bobcoin?
----------------

Bobcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bobcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bobcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bobcoin Core software, see [https://thekinglol.github.io/](https://thekinglol.github.io/).
